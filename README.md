#  Automated-Difficulty-prediction-for-Exam-Questions

## Motivation
***
* To address the challenges faced in ensuring authenticity and fairness for Test-Takers to who attempt Online Exams.
* The challenge is to ensure each question set for test-taker contains questions of similar difficulty levels.
* Come-up with a web-application which will ensure that the questions are tagged with correct difficulty level for next iteration of Exam, using machine learning analysis on the performance of test-takers for previous exam.

## Ojectives achieved
***
* Identification of the features in the Exam Question Data
* Development of Machine Learning Algorithm for predicting the difficulty levels or tags of the Question Data
* Provide User Interface for Question Creators with following features:
  * Provision for performing Machine Learning analysis on Selected Exam Data
  * Creation of Analysis report on difficulty tagging for each yearâ€˜s Exam data
  * Statistics for change in the tags, that is, deficits and excess, overall
  * Adding new Questions
  * Editing Previous Questions
  * Provided Question Revision history and provision to mark question active or inactive
  * Provided Audit trail on Questions
  * Question Sets creation with the option of shuffling and pagination
  * User Management for Admin, Question Editor and Moderator
